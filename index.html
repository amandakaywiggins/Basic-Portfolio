            <p>
                Amanda has a BA in English and Art, an MA in Theater 
                and Performance Studies, and currently works in a pharmacy 
                so, naturally, she thought learning full-stack development would be the next logical 
                step. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Honestly though, she knows design, creativity, and 
                how to finish a project. She can think on her feet 
                and likes building on the works of others both collaboratively 
                and individually. She thinks most of these skills are 
                transferable to coding, and she hopes to build more skills 
                along the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                In her spare time, Amanda likes knitting, painting, playing
                with dogs, and boxing. She likes to work with her hands
                and to read long novels. Unsuprisingly, Herman Melville's 
                Moby-Dick is her favourite book. Her top five favourite 
                bands are Stars, New Order, The Decemberists, David Bowie, 
                and Fleet Foxes. Her top five favourite foods are tacos, 
                pizza, cannoli, bread, and tacos (at the moment, y'all, 
                because she really loves food of all kinds). Sometimes she uses 
                British spellings because she lived in England for two 
                years. One day she wants to have a house and a wife and 
                a yard so she can actually garden.
                <br>
                <br>
                Amanda thinks she will be most interested in Front End 
                Development, but she is very intrigued by the mysteries
                of the Back End. Her dad works in software development, 
                so naturally he is pleased as punch that she's taking 
                an interest in his world. Though, he does wish she was 
                learning Python. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mostly, Amanda wants to always keep learning and growing. 
                And also to get really really good at coding.
